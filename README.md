# Linear Regression, ANOVA and ARIMA

## 1. Linear Regression
Examining the competition among fairy tale heroes, we collected the following data from a sample of 50 elements: the strength of the heroes [Erő], their combat ability [Küzdőképesség], and their popularity among fans [Gumimaci pontszám], which are contained in the bead52.1.csv file.
We aim to develop a linear regression model where the outcome variable is the strength of the fairy tale heroes, while the explanatory variables are combat ability and the gummy bear score.

## 2. ANOVA
The bead52.2.csv file contains some gummy bear scores for fairy tale heroes of different categories [Szuperhősök, Anti-hősök, Mellékszereplők, Főgonoszok]. Is it acceptable to assume that the differences in gummy bear scores between fairy tale heroes of different categories are negligible or 0, or can a significant difference be detected at the ε = 0.05 significance level?

## 3. Time Series - ARIMA
The bead52.3.csv file shows the gummy bear scores of an imaginary "fairy tale hero" by years and months.
Make a forecast for the expected gummy bear scores for the next months.
